In Fall 2023 I participated in a directed reading project on V.B. Alekseev's *Abel's Theorem in Problems and Solutions*. This text introduces group theory and some basic complex analysis to provide a monodromy-theoretic proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem. The notes here are incomplete but do contain some exposition from the group theoretic section.
