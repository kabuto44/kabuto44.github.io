Here are notes from MAT 217: Honors Linear Algebra, which was taught by Professor Jakub Witaszek in Spring 2024. 

[Download Notes](/downloads/MAT%20217%20Notes.pdf)

These notes are mostly based off of lectures and lecture notes by Professor Witaszek. The official course text is *Linear Algebra Done Right* by Sheldon Axler (see [Notes](/notes/) for the full list of sources consulted). The course was proof-based and included content up to inner product spaces and the Jordan form. These notes were mostly taken live, with some edits made after lectures or while reviewing for exams.
