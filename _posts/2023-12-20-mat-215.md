Here are notes from MAT 215: Single Variable Analysis with an Introduction to Proofs, which was taught by Professor Charles Fefferman in Fall 2023.

The main class text is *Understanding Analysis*, by Stephen Abbott. I also used texts including Rudin's *PMA* to write these notes (see [Notes](/notes/) for the full list). These notes were also not exactly lecture notes, but summaries of the main theorems, definitions, and a few proofs that were compiled while studying for quizzes and exams.
