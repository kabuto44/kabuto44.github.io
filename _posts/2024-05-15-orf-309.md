Here are notes from ORF 309: Probability and Stochastic Systems, which was taught by Professor Mark Cerenzia in Spring 2024. 

[Download Notes](/downloads/ORF%20309%20Notes.pdf)

These notes are mostly based off of lectures and lecture notes by Professor Cerenzia. There was no official course text; however references I used included Ross's *Introduction to Probability Models* and *Markov Chains* by J.R. Norris (see [Notes](/notes/) for the full list of sources consulted). These notes were mostly taken live, with some edits made after lectures or while reviewing for exams.
